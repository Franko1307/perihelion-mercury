*Python3* scripts for the numerical simulations of the perihelion motion of Mercury caused by General Relativity.

This folder contains four scripts:
1. `base_solution.py`: The basic visualization of Mercury orbiting the sun.
	This program can be used to observe the effects of *1/r^3* and *1/r^4* forces, as well the effects of numerical errors.
2. `template.py`: An example template file which can be handed to the students.
	The general concepts of programming in python are provided.
	The students have to write the creation of *VPython* objects as well as the computation of forces.
3. `perihelion.py`: An extension of `base_solution.py`.
	In addition to the visualization, this file also provides the numerical extraction of the perihelion motion.
